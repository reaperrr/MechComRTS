This archive contains the source code for version 0.50 of ShpEd. The code is compatible with Borland's C++Builder Version 4.0. You may use this code in anyway that you wish. I do hope that if it provides some major help to you in development of your project that you will give me some credit. 

The code is exactly in the messy state in which it was written and not very well documented. If anyone is interested in continuing the development of ShpEd and is in a position to use this code directly (i.e. has CBuilder) and needs some clarification, I will be glad to try to help. If you are merely curious, especially if you do not understand C/C++, I may not have time to answer your questions.
